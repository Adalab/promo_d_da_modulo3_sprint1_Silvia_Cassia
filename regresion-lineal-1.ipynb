Para ello os vamos a pedir que por vuestra cuenta busqueis un dataset que os guste, por ejemplo de Kaggle o de donde queráis extraerlo. De forma que vamos a probar a realizar ajustes lineales con el fin de predecir alguna de sus variables. Este dataset será el que iremos usando a lo largo de todas las sesiones de pairprogramming de regresión lineal."
